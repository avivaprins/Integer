# Integer
C++ Integer class

I have made an integer class to mimic the functionality of `int` in C++. Unlike `int`, `Integer` can hypothetically hold numbers that are much much larger. 

I've provided a main.cpp that gives some examples of its use with recursion. The script creates mxm tables in `.txt` files of [Partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory) "Partitions"), [Stirling numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_number "Stirling numbers"), and [Factorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorials")
